This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

Hi, I am Aaron. This is my first time using GitHub, and I really like how user-friendly it is so far! I would give this a score of 9.6 out of 10. Some information about me: I like sharks and ships, mostly ships. Speaking about sharks, as of today (7 July 2024), it is the beginning of Shark Week. If you have not heard of it, then you should go check it out! It is very cool stuff!

Within the realm of ships, I love to draw, study, and read about them all the time. Fun fact: I have two favorite ships, the French Ocean Liner, Normandie, and the French Ship of the Line, Bretagne.
